## About Us:

Black and Brown Female owned brand partnerships agency properly representing real and diverse lifestyles and cultures.

- Trend and Insight-driven
- Human behaviour centric
- Culturally relevant campaigns
- Content that entertains

As founders of OTa having worked in marketing and advertising for a number of years and fed up with the lack of interest in diversity, we decided to set up One Twelve to truly make a difference.

We have a passion to ensure that people who look like us are properly represented and the stories being told are accurate.

Rather than being a trend, we live and breath inclusion and this is at the forefront of everything One Twelve agency stands for.

We believe that the only way that brands will truly create diverse and inclusive campaigns is to work with creators and agencies from diverse backgrounds.
